Terrain Model:
	Built in 3dsmax based on a heightmap grabbed from terrain.party	(I chose the grand canyon area.)
		Made a 100x100 poly plane.
		Added displacement modifier with heightmap.
		Added Edit Poly modifier and moved verts with soft selection and scaling. Disabled smoothing groups here.
		Tweaked for a while.
		Added Optimize modifier with Face Threshold of 10.
		Added VertexPaint modifier.
Terrain Texture:
	Vertex paint shenanigans
		Messed with vertex paint until I liked what it looked like.
		Created an orthographic camera pointing vertically downward onto the terrain.
		Made a copy of the terrain and flattened it so the camera doesn't see shadows.
		Took a screenshot of the viewport to get the texture. Don't judge, it looks fine.
